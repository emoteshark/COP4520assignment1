# COP4520assignment1
written in c++

To run: in a linux terminal such as ubuntu, navigate to the directory containing the primes.cpp file. 
Then run the command "g++ -fpermissive prime.cpp  -lpthread". Once that is complete run the command "./a.out". 
The primes.txt file containing the output should be created in the same directory as parallel1.cpp.

THE TIME OUTPUT IS IN SECONDS. For example, if the first number in primes.txt is "8", that means it took 8 seconds to run.
<execution time> <total number of primes found> <sum of all primes found> <top ten maximum primes, listed in order from lowest to highest>
